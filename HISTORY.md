Beta11. Remove duplicate lists
## Alpha10. Review feedback from alpha
April/May 2017

GRO received feedback on the register from family history groups. They commented that the register would be more useful to them if it included historical registration districts. This historical data is currently publicly available in the GRO District Book. However, it would be difficult to add this historical data to the register due to district codes being reused over the years (the data goes back to 1837). For this reason GDS and GRO agreed to not include the historical data at this stage.
March 2017

Originally the alpha registration district register included a field that linked to the local authority registers for England and Wales. However the Welsh local authority register is still in discovery. A register in beta cannot link to another register that is in discovery. Therefore the local authority field has been removed from the registration district register so that the register can progress to beta. It will be added back in once the Welsh local authority register is in beta.

The field that has been removed is:
local-authority (a link to the local authority where the registration district is situated)
Alpha9. Find duplicate lists
March 2017

The General Register Office provided two lists of registration districts they use internally. One list included some history of registration districts that have been abolished. This history has been included in the register.

A third public list was found on the Office for National Statistics website. The data here matches the data from GRO that is now in the registration district register.
Alpha8. Meet technical standards

Alpha6. Review how register is updated
April 2017

The registration district data does not change very often. When changes are need to the data the GRO policy team will inform the custodian of the registration district register who will then ensure the updates are made to the register.
Discovery5. Review how feedback is collected
March 2017

An email link will be added to each page of the registration-district register to allow users to provide feedback. All feedback on the register product will be reviewed by GDS. All feedback about the registration-district data will be reviewed by the custodian.
Discovery4. Agree dataset
March 2017

GRO and GDS agreed to include the following fields in the register:

    registration-district (the official code used by the GRO for a registration district in England or Wales)
    name (name of the registration district)
    name-cy (Welsh name for the registration districts in Wales)
    local-authority (a link to the local authority where the registration district is situated)
    start-date (when a registration district was created)
    end-date (when a registration district was abolished)

5 abolished registration districts have been included in the dataset. Basford, Bassetlaw, Mansfield, Newark and Rushcliffe) were all merged in April 2012 to create the Nottinghamshire registration district. These recent changes have been included as the information is still relevant to the work of the GRO.
